* <b>Abstract: </b>
    Regression is a supervised learning technique which helps in finding the correlation between variables and enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on        the    one
    or more predictor variables. With an increase in number of variables and increase in model
    complexity the probability of over-fitting also increases. Regularization is a technique to
    avoid the over-fitting problem. Two well-known regularization methods for linear regression
    models are LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and RIDGE regression to handle the over-fitting issue. The size of the coefficients is reduced and over-     fitting is
    prevented by adding a penalty term to the cost function of linear regression. In our model
    we have tried to predict price of car using some features. We take dataset and try to build
    a model so that once we give new information it can predict at what price that particular
    used car can be sold. This is a regression problem because we are predicting a particular
    value; we are not just predicting particular value on which the car can be sold.

* <b>Introduction: </b>
    Those of us who go to buy used cars in Bangladesh, they usually do not have a very good
    idea about the price of the used car, it is a big problem. And those who manufacture also
    face a lot of problems in fixing the price of the car . The focus of this project is developing
    machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features.
    We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale
    prices of different makes and models. We will compare the performance of various machine
    learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression. Depending on various parameters we will determine the price of the car. Regression Algorithms are used           because    they
    provide us with continuous value as an output and not a categorized value because of which
    it will be possible to predict the actual price a car rather than the price range of a car.

* <b>Objective: </b>
   * To develop an efficient and effective model which predicts the price of a used car according
to userâ€™s inputs.
   * To achieve good accuracy.
   * To develop a User Interface (UI) which is user-friendly and takes input from the user and
predicts the price.
